 Problem Statement

Traditional decentralized exchanges (DEXs) expose traders to critical vulnerabilities:

- Front-Running: Bots monitor pending transactions and execute trades before yours
- MEV Extraction: Validators reorder transactions to extract maximum value at traders expense
- Strategy Leakage: Large orders reveal trading strategies to competitors and adversaries
- Sandwich Attacks: Traders lose millions annually to predatory trading practices
- Institutional Barriers: Privacy concerns prevent large institutions from entering DeFi

Result: Traders lose an estimated *$1.2B+ annually* to MEV and front-running attacks.



 Solution

Aztec Dark Market leverages Aztec Network privacy technology to create a fully private order book and matching engine:

  Core Features

✅ Private Order Placement - Orders remain hidden until matched (price, size, trader identity)  
✅ MEV-Resistant Execution - No transaction mempool exposure = no front-running  
✅ Zero-Knowledge Proofs - Trade settlement verified on-chain without revealing details  
✅ Institutional-Grade Privacy - Protect trading strategies and position sizes  
✅ Fair Price Discovery - Matching happens in private, preventing manipulation  
✅ Onchain Settlement - Trustless execution with cryptographic guarantees  



Technical Architecture

 Stack

- Smart Contracts: Noir (Aztec ZK-DSL)
- Privacy Layer: Aztec Network (zkRollup on Ethereum)
- Frontend: Next.js + React
- Wallet Integration: Aztec.js
- Deployment: Vercel (Frontend) + Aztec Network (Contracts)

  Privacy Model

1. Order Submission: Users create orders locally in PXE (Private Execution Environment)
2. Encryption: Order details encrypted with user's viewing keys
3. Private Matching: Orders matched off-chain using ZK proofs
4. Settlement: Only matched trades settle on-chain (amounts remain private)
5. Verification: Anyone can verify trades happened correctly without seeing details

   Security

  Current Status
- Pre-Audit: Contracts have NOT been audited yet
- Development Stage: Use at your own risk
- Funding Required: Security audit needed before mainnet

  Planned Security Measures
- Professional smart contract audit by reputable firm
- Bug bounty program post-audit
- Gradual mainnet rollout with limits
- Continuous monitoring and incident response

WARNING: Do not use with real funds until contracts are audited and deployed to mainnet.
